//! without panicking, looping forever, or reading outside itself.
//!
//! `no_single_bit_flip_can_panic_or_smuggle_a_bad_chunk` in `format.rs` is the
//! exhaustive half, over one-bit corruption of one artifact. This is the wide
//! half: many mutations, several of them structural, over a corpus of real
//! artifacts. Seeded rather than random, so a failure is reproducible and CI
//! does not go intermittent — the seed is printed and any interesting input is
//! dumped as hex.
//!
//! It is not a substitute for `cargo fuzz` (see `fuzz/`), which explores with
