//! Calling one compiled function, with the environment and receiver Rhai gives
//! it.
//!
//! A program's library, source and module resolver used to be installed around
//! its *main chunk* only, so a function reached through `call_fn` ran without
//! them. That is not a corner: the compiler leaves anything it cannot lower as
//! an AST in the library, and Rhai finds it only in `global.lib`.
//!
//! The other half is `this`. An event handler bound to its state through
//! `bind_this_ptr` is the common shape of a `call_fn` caller, and the whole of
//! what these check is that a `Vm` answers such a call the way an `Engine`
//! does — including that a write through `this` lands in the caller's value.
