//! What the AST costs, and what the VM costs instead.
//!
//! This is the instrument the project's premise rests on. Rhai's tree costs
//! ~24 bytes of device heap per minified source byte, and traffic-light's
//! `firmware/src/script.rs:88-92` records something the retained figure misses:
//! "rhai's parser allocates well past the size of the tree it finally keeps, so
//! the peak during `compile` is what has to fit, not the result." So this
//! tracks peak as well as retained — traffic-light's own harness tracks only
//! retained, and peak is the number that actually bounds script size.
//!
//! # Why this is one test in its own file
//!
//! The counters are process-global, and cargo runs tests on parallel threads.
//! Any concurrent allocation lands in the same counters and corrupts every
//! reading. One `#[test]`, in its own binary, is what keeps the numbers real.
//! traffic-light learned the same thing (commit bee5fb5, "Fold the allocation
//! measurement into the one test that owns the counters").
//!
//! # What these numbers are not
//!
//! Host figures. They do not transfer to a device by halving: traffic-light
//! measured the engine ratio at 0.71 rather than 0.5, and found the AST does
//! not shrink on 32-bit at all, because `Dynamic`, `i64` and `f32` fields are
//! the same width either way. Device numbers have to come from a device.
//!
//! The fixtures are one build's source, checked in byte-identical to the script
//! the published figures came from, so the whole binary is a default-build
//! measurement — see the note above `allocation_footprint`.
