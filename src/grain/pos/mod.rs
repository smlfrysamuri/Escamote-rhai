//! Turning a Rhai Grain instruction address back into a source position,
//! without `std`.
//!
//! A Rhai Grain artifact carries no positions in its instruction stream. They
//! live in a separate table, so a device can be shipped the bytecode alone and
//! the table kept on the host that compiled it — which is the point, because a
//! position on every instruction is a large fraction of the artifact and is
//! never read unless something fails.
//!
//! What comes back is a [`Site`]: a line and a column as plain numbers.
//! This crate does not know what a [`Position`][crate::Position] is, and
//! deliberately so, since the reason to keep the table on-device is to report
//! an error without linking the compiler that produced it.
//!
//! ## Where this sits
//!
//! It resolves the first hop only. A script that was minified before it was
//! compiled needs a second: the [`Site`] is a position in the *minified*
//! source, and a Source Map v3 resolver such as
//! [`rhaiper-map`](https://crates.io/crates/rhaiper-map) takes it the rest of
//! the way to the original.
//!
//! ```text
//! instruction address --[this crate]--> minified line:col --[a source map]--> original
//! ```
//!
//! ## Table format
//!
//! ```text
//! varint          entry count
//! per entry:      varint  address delta from the previous entry
//!                 varint  line, 1-based (0 means the site is unknown)
//!                 varint  column, 1-based (0 means the start of a line)
//! ```
//!
//! Entries are sorted by address, so a lookup walks until it reaches or passes
//! the one it wants and stops. That is a linear scan, which is the right shape
//! for something only consulted when a program has already failed.
