    /// takes it after arguments, but the fallback that a shared or unbound
    /// receiver lands in reads and flattens it first.

    /// pre-mutation value, and an unbound `f(this, no_such)` report

    /// [`ErrorVariableNotFound`][crate::EvalAltResult::ErrorVariableNotFound].

///
/// [`Program`]: crate::grain::Program
///
/// ### A Stack Machine
///
/// Operands are pushed and consumed on an operand stack, and locals live in
/// slots addressed directly.
///
/// ### Residual Fragments
///
/// [`Op::EvalAst`] is the escape hatch that hands a fragment back to Rhai's
/// [`AST`][crate::AST] interpreter, so anything the compiler cannot yet lower
/// still runs, and the whole language stays covered.
///
/// Lowering more of it converts residuals into instructions rather than adding
/// coverage.
///
/// ### Not the Executed Form
///
/// A [`Program`]'s code is a byte slice, and dispatched on directly, so a
/// loaded [`Program`] can borrow its instructions from the artifact rather than
/// building sixteen bytes of enum per instruction.
///
/// ### Positions
///
/// Instructions carry no source position.
///
/// Several of them can fail against a place in the source, and the position
/// for that comes from the [`Program`]'s positions table, keyed on the
/// instruction's own address.
///
/// Keeping it out means the diagnostics can be stripped from an artifact
/// without touching the code.
///
/// ### Operand Width
///
/// Anything too wide for an operand is a `u32` index into one of the
/// [`Program`]'s pools, which is also what keeps a repeated operator or name
/// from being stored twice.

    /// ### Syntactic Function Calls
    ///
    /// Calls that Rhai handles syntactically before dispatch — `Fn`, `call`,
    /// `curry`, `eval`, `is_def_var` — are excluded as they are implemented
    /// natively.

    ///
    /// The position table's entry for this instruction is the call site.
    ///
    /// Rhai's dispatch path takes one and reports failures against it so an error
    /// that comes back without a position gets this one.
    ///
    /// ### Operator Call
    ///

    /// Pop `argc` arguments and call the function named by `name` with a variable
    /// as its first argument, taken by reference, pushing the result.
    ///
    /// ### Rewrite to `&mut`
    ///
    /// Rhai rewrites `f(x, ..)` into `x.f(..)` whenever the first argument is a
    /// plain variable, so that a `&mut` first parameter mutates the variable
    /// rather than a copy.

    /// For example: `push(a, 2)` and `a.push(2)` are the same call; only the
    /// second reached the mutation through [`Op::Chain`].
    ///
    /// Two things follow from the rewrite, and together they are why this is an
    /// instruction rather than an argument order:
    ///
    /// * the variable is read *after* the other arguments, so an argument that
    ///   writes to it is seen;
    /// * a shared or read-only variable is passed by value instead — Rhai hands
    ///   out a reference to neither.

    /// ### Clean Up
    ///
    /// The subject must be manually popped at the end of the statement,
    /// or when control flow jumps out from inside the switch statement,
    /// exiting a loop, or via an error caught by a `try` block.
    ///
    /// ### Always Jumps
    ///
    /// The table's default is where a subject that matches nothing goes,
    /// and an absent `_` arm compiles to a jump past the statement.

    /// One instruction for the whole chain rather than one per step, because
    /// the walk holds a `&mut` into the container at every level and a borrow
    /// cannot survive a trip round the dispatch loop.

    /// Index values and method arguments were pushed before it, in step order.
    Chain(u32),

    ///
    /// Upon exiting a statements block, everything the block declared must be
    /// dropped.
    UnwindTo(u16),

    /// [`Engine::max_operations`][crate::Engine::set_max_operations], and give

    ///
    /// Emitted on loops.
    ///
    /// ### Behavioral Differences
    ///
    /// Rhai ticks per [`AST`][crate::AST] node, but the VM ticks only upon
    /// entering a loop, and on jump back-edges, so the operation counts
    /// **will** differ.
    ///
    /// What this preserves is that a *limit* is enforced and an interrupt is
    /// honoured, which is what allows `loop {}` to be killed.
    ///
    /// ### Position
    ///
    /// Its table entry is read on every iteration rather than only on failure,
    /// which is why the in-memory position table is dense.

    /// ### Note
    ///
    /// Rhai rewinds a nested block whether it left normally or by a `throw`,
    /// and never rewinds the top level of a chunk.
    ///
    /// The normal path is [`Op::UnwindTo`], which an escaping error jumps
    /// straight past — so the frame needs a floor to fall back to, and the
    /// last top-level statement boundary is exactly it.
    ///
    /// ### Cost
    ///
    /// Emitted once before each top-level statement of a chunk that runs in the
    /// caller's [`Scope`][crate::Scope], so it costs nothing per iteration and
    /// nothing at all to a function body, whose [`Scope`][crate::Scope] is
    /// discarded whole.
    Checkpoint,

    /// A statement begins here, at nesting `depth` within its chunk.
    ///
    /// Where the debugger stops.
    ///
    /// `depth` is how many statements enclose this one. It is what stepping
    /// re-arms against: Rhai restores the stepping state when the statement it
    /// was asked at *ends*, and the next marker at the same depth or shallower
    /// is where that has happened.
    ///
    /// Without it, a `next` over an `if` would step into its body.
    ///
    /// ### Behavioral Differences
    ///
    /// Rhai runs its callback per [`AST`][crate::AST] node and a chunk has
    /// no nodes, so the compiler records where the statements were and the
    /// VM stops there instead.
    ///
    /// Without this, there is nothing for the debugger to stop at, and
    /// break-points and stepping will be inert.
    ///
    /// ### Cost
    ///
    /// Emitted only under the `debugging` feature.
    ///
    /// An instruction per statement is not worth carrying to a device with
    /// no debugger callback to call, so a shipping build has none.
    ///
    /// Decoding is unconditional, so an artifact written by a `debugging`
    /// build still runs anywhere — it simply cannot be stopped by a debugger.

    /// and decides whether locals it declares survive:
    ///
    /// * Statement fragments rewind, so they cannot disturb the scope shape

    /// Only errors Rhai considers *catchable* are caught: `return`, `break`,

    /// something that cannot be re-created, so it is made once here and lives
    /// until the loop ends.

    /// ### Position
    ///
    /// Its table entry is the iterable's *start* position, which is what

    /// operand stack, which is why the verifier gives it explicit successors.
    ///
    /// ### Position
    ///
    /// Its table entry is the iterable's position — `position`, not
    /// `start_position` — because that is what a fallible iterator's error is
    /// filled in with.
